# andelladatachallenge
The jupyter  notebook was used to write this solution 
This script is very very accurate .
This challenge consumes api , insert it into database via sqlalchemy and uses pandas  library to load dataset into memory and  processes it.
The python script processapifromtms.ipynb is  use for the processing while 
the script createtables.ipynb is  to create the tables in the database via the sqlalchemy.
The  name  of the  database  is apisamplecalls and  the two tables are playingintheatre and playinginmovieontv.
Also note that the  api calls can fluctuate  due to  the server  response .
I will be available for questions incase the  need arises .
